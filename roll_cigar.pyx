  You can 'read along' with these tests from the Readme developers section

  Test a fully matching read
  >>> t_read = ['ATTG','~~~~', 0]; \
  p_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]; \
  roll_cigar(t_read, p_arr)
  (1, '4M')

  Test for read with insert
  >>> t_read = ['TTGT', '~~~~', 1]; \
  roll_cigar(t_read, p_arr)
  (2, '3M1I')

  Another test for read with insert
  >>> t_read = ['TGTT', '~~~~', 2]; \
  roll_cigar(t_read, p_arr)
  (3, '2M2I')

  Test for read with delete at end - should not show up in CIGAR
  >>> t_read = ['TTAC', '~~~~', 4]; \
  roll_cigar(t_read, p_arr)
  (5, '2I2M')

  Test for read spanning a deletion - should get a delete
  >>> t_read = ['ACAC', '~~~~', 0]; \
  p_arr = [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; \
  roll_cigar(t_read, p_arr)
  (1, '2M2D2M')

  We actually missed this case: read with one matching base and then a delete
  >>> t_read = ['CACT', '~~~~', 1]; \
  roll_cigar(t_read, p_arr)
  (2, '1M2D3M')

  Test for an unmapped read: pos and cigars should be None
  >>> t_read = ['AATT', '~~~~', 2]; \
  p_arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; \
  roll_cigar(t_read, p_arr)
