Release Notes
=============


2.6.0 (Internal testing release)

- MQ plots
- D_err plots

2.5.0 (Internal testing release)

- Added god-aligner


2.4.0 (Internal testing release)

Algorithm changes
-----------------

- Read POS and CIGAR generation algorithm redesigned
- Ploidy of genome now inferred from VCF file.
  Simulation will properly handle XY chromosomes and polyploidy IF the VCF GT is properly set
- Standard BED file is used to select regions
  - BED file should avoid 'NNN' regions
- Read generation order is much less serial

Data changes
------------

- qname contains list of variant sizes carried by read
  This makes variant based analyses of alignments easier
- CIGAR for reads from inside long insertion properly handled
- Name of sample included in read
  - Can mix in viral contamination
  - Can do tumor/normal mixes


Program design changes
----------------------

- Written for Python 3
- One entry command ('mitty')
  This allows us convenient access to all mitty commands
- Better support for UNIX paradigms such as pipes and process substitution
- Better parallelization
