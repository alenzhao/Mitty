"""This reads.py plugin generates tiled reads with a guaranteed coverage for every base. The reads are taken
deterministically, starting at the beginning of the sequence and then taking reads with the requested overlap. The
overlap of the last read is adjusted so we cover every base. When we get to the end of the sequence we wrap around and
start with a shifted offset.
