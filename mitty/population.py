"""
This module implements a haploid genome as a diff with respect to a reference (which never needs to be explicitly set).
The contents of the class, therefore, correspond directly to a very strict version of the VCF and each genome can be
written out as a VCF file.

The internal structure of an attached pair of chromosomes is a list of tuples of the form:

(start, stop, REF, ALT, het)

The module implements the following useful population functions and their supporting functions

crossover(g1, rng, params) -> g2  simulating cross over between copies of chromosomes
fertilization(g1, g2, rng)   -> g3  simulating creation of a child from parents
denovo(g1, ref, rng, params)  -> g3  the only function that requires the original seq - generates denovo mutations

The module implements and uses the following utility functions

parse_vcf(vcf_reader)  -> g1 read in a VCF file and convert it to out haploid genome format
vcf2chrom(vcf_reader)  -> c1 read in one chromosome from a VCF file
write_to_vcf(fname, g1) write the data to a compressed, indexed VCF file

Internally, the only operation that violates sorting order is denovo, so this uses a blist.sortedlist. For everything
else we use a plain Python list as we only append items (and that is O(1) for a list)




get_rngs(seed)  ->  rng  return a list of random number generators that are used by the different functions

The internal genome format is a simple list of tuples almost corresponding to the VCF

(start, stop, REF, ALT)

The following worker functions operate on single copies of chromosomes

merge(c1, c2) -> c3  merge the descriptions of the two chromosomes
                     This figures out any het mutations. The output is sorted and is of the VCF format
                    (POS, POS1, REF, ALT, HET) We only need this when saving back to VCF



Though we could have written a class called genome, I prefer to write in as functional a style as possible for better
code quality.
