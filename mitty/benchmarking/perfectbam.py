"""In order to perform our alignment analysis we need to go through the BAM file and classify whether each read was
correctly aligned or not. The following back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate to us what size of data we are
expecting for a 30x illumina whole genome dataset:

# reads = 30 * 3e9 / 100 = 900e6 (900 million reads)

If about 5% if these are misaligned/unmapped, we have 45 million misaligned reads

For debugging purposes we store complete read data for only the incorrectly aligned reads. These are stored in a
database which offers efficient enough retrieval for debugging.

For comprehensive data analysis, where we want to compute alignment accuracy over different spots of the genome, but are
not interested in the read details - like sequence and base quality score - we only store the following information

chrom,
cpy,
start_pos  - 4 bytes  start of read
stop_pos   - 4 bytes  end of read    = start of read + read length
category   - 1 byte
---------------------
             9 bytes

The category flags are defined as follows

---------------------------------
| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
---------------------------------
          |   |   |   |   |   |
          |   |   |   |   |   \------  1 => chrom was wrong
          |   |   |   |   \----------  1 => pos was wrong
          |   |   |   \--------------  1 => cigar was wrong
          |   |   \------------------  1 => unmapped
          |   \----------------------  1 => read from reference region (no variants)
          \--------------------------  1 => mate is from reference region


To store this data for a 30x WG Illumina run will take 9 x 900e6 ~ 8.1 GB

This can  be loaded onto a modern machine. For this reason, we don't do anything very fancy and simply store the
categorized reads as a set of compressed numpy arrays using readily available mechanisms.

The categorized reads are stored in POS sorted order. The primary analysis we are are considering is to count the number
of correct and total reads in the vicinity of a series of positions (usually variants) or for the whole sequence without
regard to position (e.g. for reference reads).

The most efficient way to do this is to walk through the sorted list of reads side by side with the sorted list of
variants and count the relevant reads as we go.

  3. Produce a compressed numpy array file with details of all the reads in the file

      chrom_cc   - 8 bit int: bit 0 -> chrom copy 0=0, 1=1  bit 1 onwards -> original chromosome of read

      We could have split up the arrays into no_of_chroms x 2 arrays and dropped the chromosome field for space savings
      but this makes the code more complex since we no longer no how large to make the arrays.
      It also makes computations on the whole genome faster.
