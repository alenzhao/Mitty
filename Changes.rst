Roadmap
-------

v 4.0.0 April 2016
  - Fuzzer integration


v 3.0.0 Jan 2016
  - Preliminary integration with platform

    - Minimum: should be able to run on platform and produce reports
    - extensions to CWL?
    - should be able to interpret pipeline description to allow us to build


v 2.0.0 Dec 2015
  - Variant Call comparator

    - Includes report generator
    - modular: should support several types of comparators
    - visualizations for comparisons
    - meta analysis of quantified results

  - Haplotype block generator
  - Better simulation management on platform via metadata(?)

Planned changes
---------------
* change CLIs to allow parameter files to be fed in from std in (piped as a file)
* vcf-write should have option to remove unzipped .vcf file
* variants only reads - need to properly handle end of variants
* finish implementing ad hoc filtering for variants

   - het/hom filtering in standard population model
   - range filter for variations (put as core spec - like for reads - rather than in population model?)

* alindel_plot should handle case where there are no indels (log scaling fails)
* [Wrappers] Use metadata to keep track of files from different aligner versions
* [Wrappers] Have perfectbam and alindel and alindel plot operate on lists (doing scatter gather possibly)

Possible changes
----------------
* Interpret lower case in FASTA as repeat regions and have option to avoid these for variants and reads
* (non-backward compatible) change reads.json format such that read model name is key for model parameters
  much like how it is done for variant models.
* Heuristic for coverage per block?

Changelog
---------

**1.25.0.dev0**

2015.10.26
* Combine multiple (or at least two) BADBAMs to perform intersection and difference analyses. Interactive tool?


2015.10.20
* matrix plot should show light gray dots for grid points


2015.10.19
* Implemented option to filter multiple allele loci.


2015.10.14
* Update plot_align (diff ways to plot mis-alignments) to work with BAM+tags way of saving misalignments

2015.10.11
  * Improved documentation

2015.10.07
  * In read simulator/plugins 'SSS..' for the sequence/phred score strings has been changed into 'O' ('object', like for variants)
  * Some of the read plugin code has been abstracted into a base class, allowing us a standard dtype for the numpy arrays
    and one common helper function (get_zero_reads)

----

**1.18.0.dev0**

2015.10.06
  * Enhancement: Full chain upto indel accuracy plot now works
  * Enhancement: Ad hoc post filters implemented in standard population model.
    het/hom filters still need to be implemented
  * Bugfix: Now have a function return empty read array. This fixes an issue with read array concatenation: If we asked for
    reads from variants only, but there were no variants, we would try to concatenate an empty list which would lead to
    an error. This also fixes the problem that in such a condition the paired-endedness of the file would be uncertain.

----

**1.16.0.dev0**

2015.10.05
  * Read length information added to qname

2015.10.01
  * Instead of making several different files write out the alignment accuracy in the original BAM itself.
    Still produce a perfect BAM as needed

2015.09.29
  * Modified read simulator to allow reads to be generated over a sub-region of a chromosome.
    Coverage is correct. Sub-regions have to be set chromosome-by-chromosome.
    Parameter file format change is backwards compatible. Existing parameter files will work correctly with new version
  * Added flag in read simulator to write gzipped fasta file.
    Existing parameter files will work correctly with new version
