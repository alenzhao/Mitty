Population simulations
----------------------
Each sample genome is generated by sampling variants from a master list. The variant plugins return candidate variants
which are added to the master list. Each variant :math:`i` in this list has a probability :math:`p_i` of being found in
a given sample.

The distribution of

The population simulations are based on sub-sampling
