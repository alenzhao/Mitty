Population simulations
----------------------
The human genome is about 3 billion base-pairs (characters) long. Between any two humans, there are about 3 million
points at which their genomes differ. We have arbitrarily chosen to sequence the genomes from a tiny group of humans and
combine them into one genome which we call the reference genome. For every other human that we sequence, we compare
their genome against this reference and report the differences. These differences are called variants, because they are
the points of variation from the reference.

Variant call format (VCF)
.........................
The convention in the bio-informatics community is to write out these variants in a tabular form, indicating the chromosome
and position of the point of deviation, the reference sequence at that point and the altered (variant) sequence found at
that point in the sample. These tabular files are called variant call format files. When we have several individuals
constituting a sample from a population, we write out all the unique variants row-wise and have a separate column for
each individual indicating if that variant exists in that individual (and whether the individual is heterozygous or
homozygous for that variant)

The site frequency spectrum
...........................
In practice, it is observed, that some variants are very common across the population and some are very rare, sometimes
being found only in one individual. It is possible to organize this information, in a slightly counter intuitive manner,
in a plot called the site frequency spectrum. This is a plot of counts of variants seen only once, only twice and so on
in the sample being considered.


Variant growth curve
....................






Each sample genome is generated by sampling variants from a master list. The variant plugins return candidate variants
which are added to the master list. Each variant :math:`i` in this list has a probability :math:`p_i` of being found in
a given sample.
