Simulation of genomes
=====================

Please see :doc:`variants` for details on the internal representation of variations


Population simulations
----------------------
Populations simulations start with a founder population. The founder population can be generated independently or
incrementally. An independent founder population is equivalent to running ``denovo`` multiple times with a different
random seed each time resulting in non-overlapping VCF files (any overlap will be due to chance). An incrementally
generated founder population starts out with a master sample and then further samples are generated by deleting and
adding a fraction of variations to the master.

For some requirements, the initial founder population is enough, while for others, we need to simulate sexual
reproduction over several generations. Sexual reproduction mimics mendelian shuffling of variants, recombination
and denovo mutations. A simulation of fitness and recessiveness is also incorporated which simulates the weeding out
of deleterious mutations

For other requirements we simulate high rates of denovo mutations
