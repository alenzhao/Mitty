Mitty is a collection of modules and scripts that enable us to generate simulated genomic data to test our algorithms.

(Since you were dying to know: Mitty comes from James Thurber's "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" one of my favourite
pieces from one of my favourite authors. Though [Wikipedia][wiki] has a less favourable interpretation of what Walter Mitty
stands for I follow the interpretation found in the 2013 movie of the same name. Life is difficult full of
insurmountable obstacles. If you do not even dream that you have surmounted these obstacles how are you going to even
start?)
