"""This script reads in a BAM file created by `reads.py` and 'aligns' the reads by using the coordinates stored in the
seq id string. This 'aligned' file can be read in using a visualizer to debug the simulation chain.

Usage:
cheata --inbam=BAM  --outbam=BAM  [-v]

Options:
  --inbam=INBAM           Input (unaligned) bam file name of reads from reads.py
  --outbam=OUTBAM         Output (perfectly aligned) bam file name
  -v                      Dump detailed logger messages

Notes:
1. Recall that the seq id of each read is the string 'rN:S1:S2' where N is the number of the read,
   S1 the start of the first read and S2 the start of the mate pair. Unpaired reads have no S2
2. As of v 0.2.0 there is a quirk with pysam writing BAM files where alignments have some hidded problem when written as
BAM from cheatah. My wor around is to save as SAM and then convert to BAM which seems to not create any problems.
